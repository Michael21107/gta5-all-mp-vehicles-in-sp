The mod adds all the vehicles from GTA Online into GTA 5. You can find the new cars in parking lots throughout Los Santos and Blaine County.

- All the content from GTA Online is added, including air and water vehicle, except for vehicles from early updates that are available in single player (SP).
- Over 100 spawn points for new vehicles.
- The vehicle spawns in parking lots are constantly changing.
- All the military vehicles from GTA Online (including both versions of the Oppressor) are added to the military base at Fort Zancudo.
- Specific spawn points are chosen for various types of specialized vehicles, which justify their presence in the game's lore.


Thanks to Vincentsgm for helping with the installation of the livery for the Brickade 6x6.
