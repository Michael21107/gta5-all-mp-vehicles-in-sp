# gta5-all-mp-vehicles-in-sp
The mod adds all the vehicles from GTA Online to GTA 5. The new cars can be found in parking lots throughout Los Santos and Blaine County and on the road in general traffic.

- All content from GTA Online is added, including air and water vehicles, except vehicles from previous updates that are available in Single Player (SP).
- Over 100 new vehicle spawn points.
- You may come across a DLC car in traffic. Each class of car can only be found on certain roads and sections of road.
- Parking lot vehicle spawns are constantly changing.
- All military vehicles from GTA Online (including both versions of the Oppressor) will be added to the military base at Fort Zancudo.
- Specific spawn points are chosen for different types of specialized vehicles to justify their presence in the game's lore.
